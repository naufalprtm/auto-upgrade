# Auto Upgrade Installer

This script is designed to update and upgrade various system packages and software tools on your Linux system—because let’s be honest, if you’re still using outdated software, are you even living? It handles the installation and upgrading of essential development tools, programming languages, and other useful utilities, along with setting up a network topology that your future self will thank you for (or roll their eyes at, depending on how well you followed the instructions).

## Features

- System package updates and upgrades (because stagnation is for ponds, not software)
- Installation and upgrading of:
  - Node.js (for all your asynchronous procrastination needs)
  - Docker (so you can pretend your containers are less of a mess than your life)
  - Docker Compose (for when you want to over-engineer your problems)
  - Python3 and pip (because you still think whitespace matters)
  - Poetry (for the artsy developers who need to rhyme their code)
  - Rust (for when you want your code to be as painful as a hangover)
  - Go (because who doesn’t want a language that sounds like a command?)
  - systemd (because service management was just too easy before)
  - Java and Maven (for when you want to deal with dependency hell)
  - Gradle (the tool that finally made XML files look good)
  - Ansible (for automating all the things you’d rather not do manually)
  - Terraform (because your infrastructure should be just as complicated as your relationships)
  - AWS CLI (so you can pay for cloud services like it’s going out of style)
  - Azure CLI (because why limit your cloud confusion to one platform?)
  - Kubernetes kubectl (for when you want to orchestrate chaos)
  - Minikube (for the hipster developers who want to run Kubernetes on their laptops)
  - Helm (because everyone loves a good pirate reference)
  - CMake (for those who think ‘simple’ is overrated)
  - Nginx (the only web server that can handle your load, unlike your last date)
  - PostgreSQL (because SQL is the only language that understands you)
  - MySQL (for those who enjoy living dangerously)
  - Redis (because fast data access is better than slow romantic relationships)
  - MongoDB (for when you want your data to be as flexible as your morals)
  - jq (for parsing JSON like a pro or a masochist)
  - tree (because even files need to show off their family tree)
  - wget (for downloading files like it’s 1999)
  - screen (so you can pretend to multitask)
  - zip and unzip (for your emotional baggage)
  - supervisor (because managing processes should feel like herding cats)
  - fish shell (for those who want their command line to be as colorful as their personalities)
- System cleanup after installation (because nobody likes a cluttered system or a cluttered mind)
- Network topology setup with:
  - IP addressing configuration (for when you want your devices to talk to each other, like they’re at a bar)
  - DHCP configuration (for when you want to let fate decide your IP addresses)
  - NAT setup (because everyone loves a good disguise)
- Language options for user interface:
  - English (default, for the majority of the civilized world)
  - Indonesian
  - Russian
  - Chinese
  - Turkish
  - Thai
  - Alien language option (for when you want to feel out of this world, because why not?)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/naufalprtm/auto-upgrade.git
   cd auto-upgrade
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**

   ```
   chmod +x auto_upgrade.sh
   ```
3. **Run the script:**

   ```
   ./auto_upgrade.sh
   ```      

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed before running the script. The script will check for package versions and install any missing dependencies as needed. Just remember, if something breaks, it’s probably your fault for not reading the fine print—or maybe it’s just the universe playing tricks on you.

## Cleanup
After installation, the script will perform a system cleanup to remove unnecessary files and free up space—because no one wants their hard drive looking like their attic. Seriously, if you have old files from 2010, it’s time to let go.

**Feel free to adjust the content and sections according to your specific requirements and preferences. If your code breaks, just blame it on the script and walk away like a true champion.**
